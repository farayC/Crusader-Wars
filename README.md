# What is Crusader Wars?
Crusader Wars is a complete overhaul of Crusader Kings 3 warfare system making it possible to fight your battles in a 1:1 scale in Total War: Attila.
# Current features:
## v1.0 "Warfare"
### Land Battles 
Fight your Crusader Kings 3 battles in Total War: Attila, covering every aspect of each battle!
### Accurate Battle Results
Every casuality of the battle is 100% accurate to their regiment and army their in!
### Time Period
We have mapped each CK3 culture, heritage, and Men-At-Arms with a collection of Attila mods to be the most historically accurate possible, covering a range from 8th-Century to 15th-Century.
### Levies Compositions
Each culture and heritage also have their unique levies compositions, some can be infantry focused, other's can be cavalry focused.You will feel each one uniqueness!
### Regiments Cultures
Every Crusader Kings 3 regiment has their hometown culture, and you will see every cultural difference in battle!
### Commanders
The army commander will be the Total War general unit with his strength and XP level being based on his noble rank, bodyguards, and prowess. His martial skills represent a major role on the battlefield, increasing the whole army's XP level and the amount and quality of defensive deployable when defending.
### Knights
Each knight is also present in a unit and each one of their prowess and martial increases the strength of it individually. Their lord's knight effectiveness also increases their unit xp. Their cultural unit will be the major culture amongst them or their realm.
### Acclaimed Knights
An acclaimed knight is an important factor on the knight's unit, they get more soldiers than a regular knight and based on their accolade attributes and glory rank they give a special ability to the knight's unit.
### Characters Health
What happens on the battlefield, doesn't stayt on the battlefield! If your generals or knights fall, they will get injured, captured or even die! And, if your characters are fighting with injures, they will get a soldiers penalty in their unit.
### Terrain
The Total War battle map will be based on the CK3 battle terrain and defending armies in mountains, hills, etc... will always get the high ground.
### Unique Maps
You will fight in some unique maps depending on the special building on the province you are fighting in.
### Weather
The month the battle takes place is also accounted to make the battle atmosphere resemble the season they are in! Winter severity also increases the amount of winter effects there is on the Total War battle.
### Seamless as Possible
With a press of a button, the mod opens up Attila with the correct mods and after the battle, it compresses the edited save file to have totaly fast loading speeds!
### Integrated Attila Mod Manager
Enable and disable secondary mods in the Options menu!

# ----------------------------How does it work?----------------------------
If you want to code a mod like this, these are the major steps to achieve it:
## Crusader Kings 3 Data Output:
There are two ways Crusader Wars outputs data for it to interpret. One is by Console Commands, the other is by a Save File.
I created a mod for CK3 that consists of a button on the ```window_combat.gui```, that when pressed, will create a save file and then execute some console commands that output some important data, which the Crusader Wars app, will read from the ```console_history.txt``` located in ```Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\``` folder.

## Crusader Kings 3 Data Reading:
80% of data Crusader Wars reads from is from the save file directly, the rest on the console_history.txt file.
On the Save File, it reads data from these sections (in order):
- combats
- traits_lookup
- armies
- units
- army_regiments
- regiments
- landed_titles
- counties
- mercenary_company_manager
- living
- accolades
- court_positions
- culture_manager

On the console_history.txt it gets this data, which is: 
- Year and Month
- Battle Name
- Left & Right Realm Names
- User Character ID and Culture ID
- Left & Right Main Participants Character ID and Culture ID
- Left & Right Commanders Character ID, Culture ID, Martial Value, Prowess Value, and Feudal Rank
- Left & Right Knights Character ID, Names and Prowess Value
- Knights Effectiveness
- Terrain Type
- Province ID
- Winter Severity
- Special Building in the Holding
- Left & Right Advantages Modifiers
- KEYWORD, for the app to detect a battle has started
```

## Total War: Attila Data Input
With all this data, Crusader Wars creates a historical battle .modpack with the help of the RPFM app.
By following this tutorial as I did in the early development of this mod, you will know which data to insert on the .modpack https://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?815366-Scripted-Historical-Battles
